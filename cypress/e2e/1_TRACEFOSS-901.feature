Feature: ðŸŽ« [QG][TESTING][FE] Trace-X Test Pipeline integration with Cypress + CuCumber and Xray
	#*As a* Test Manager 
	#*I want to* have frontend tests automated, reproducible and executed at any time 
	#*so that* I can detect regressions, retest on any code change and test the functionality for a complex frontend with low efforts AND can implement well-defined INT Tests.
	#h2. Details
	# * Concept [[^C-X XrayCucumberCypress.pdf]]
	# * Xray Test Management - Product Walkthrough for Jira Server/DC: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73a16-yXAfA]
	# * [https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/github-actions]
	# * Testing in Chrome and Firefox with Cypress Docker Images [https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/github-actions#Testing-in-Chrome-and-Firefox-with-Cypress-Docker-Images]
	#
	#h2. Solution
	# * in github actions we will have 2 separated jobs in terms of E2E cucumber tests
	# ** E2E tests (default, without Jira (Xray) integration) - triggered automatically by PR, contains tests definition in repository
	# ** E2E tests - Xray (optional, require Jira (Xray) integration) - triggered manually byt Test Manager , can fetch tests scenarios from Jira (Xray) -> run tests -> push results to XrayÂ 
	# *** as a parameter of this task, we can use e.g. Jira filter id to be able customize set of test definitions we want to fetch from Jira and run
